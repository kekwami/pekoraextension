## Update Logs:
+ Recoded this entire extension to be compatible for all users, got rid of a ton of clunky unused logic
+ PLEASE NOTE: you need to refresh the page once or twice for values to populate due to Pekora's dynamically filled UI. The window will prompt you to refresh if it is needed.
+ p.s. wanted to get something basic out there for people to use for the time being, will add a ton of QOL features in the coming weeks! (sorry, had some finals this week >.<)
